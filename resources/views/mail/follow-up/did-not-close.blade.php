    Dear {{ $customer->first_name }},
    <br>
    <br>
    I am one of the seniors at SolCal Energy. I noticed that you recently inquired about the <strong>net
        metering</strong> program through
    {{ $powerCompany }} and you may not have made a final decision to get started. Net Metering is an alternative
    clean energy rate plan that can <u>significantly reduce your electric bills from 20%-50%.</u> The best part is
    that
    there is <u>no cost to enroll</u> and <u>there are no solar panels to buy or lease.</u> You simply do what you are
    doing now. Pay for power.
    Just at a much lower cost.
    <br>
    <br>
    I will greatly appreciate it if you let me know what I can do to help you get enrolled in this program.

</p>

Thank you,
